# EV-scheduling

 The world is moving quickly towards Electric Vehi
 cles(EV) and the required infrastructures are also developed in
 a rapid pace. Therefore it is very significant to contemplate the
 effect on the power grid due to EV charging most importantly on
 the Distribution network. Increase in widespread presence of EV
 Charging Stations are a certainty and it may lead to increase in
 voltage fluctuations, power losses and drop in power factor. This
 paper presents a method to reduce the cost of charging the EVs
 by Optimal scheduling in a charging station under real time
 pricing while fulfilling the charging demand of the customers.
 This method is applied in an IEEE 33-Bus Test system with a
 PV system connected to the charging station, where the voltage
 fluctuations and power losses are calculated and analysed. The
 results produced indicate that the cost is reduced roughly around
 15% to 25%.
